      <h2 class="subheading">The E in Backend</h2>
      <p>
        Did you know that the <b>“E” in “backend”</b> stands for <b>Express</b>?
        Well, that may not be true for you, dear readers, but it is the absolute
        truth for me! If you are looking for someone to convince you why Express
        is the best tool for your backend and encourage you to use it, then you
        are in the right place. In this blog, I will share how much I love
        Express and why I use it. I am confident that you will enjoy it as much
        as I do!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a programmer who loves backend development like me, chances
        are you have heard about Express at some point in your life. But for
        those who have never heard of it, Express is a very well known Node.js
        web application framework today. Why? Because it is <b>easy</b>,
        <b>well-documented</b>, and <b>unopinionated</b>, which means that it
        does not follow a strict set of rules or standard, you are free to use
        it however you like.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="subheading">When It All Started</h2>
      <p>
        When I first started coding, I was curious about how web applications
        worked under the hood. I thought that they all just ran in the browser.
        But I was actually wrong. I learned that there are layers and layers of
        abstraction that make it possible for things to be displayed on the
        screen. At a high level, most web pages get their data from outside
        sources running on separate computers. These computers are called
        servers, and they can use entirely different programming languages to
        serve information to the client. In this case, Express uses
        <b>JavaScript</b>, a programming language I use the most.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I learned about this, I was so happy because I wasn’t expecting it
        to be this easy and intuitive to learn. I realized that there is so much
        I can do with Express to meet my needs, and that my system doesn’t have
        to be complex for it to deliver what I want. Ever since then, I have
        used Express for all of my web projects, without even considering other
        technologies. It gives me all the control I need: no unnecessary files
        and folders, easy management of routes and endpoints, readable syntax,
        and much more to make my workflow quicker and more efficient. It helps
        me prioritize the problem at hand instead of deviating my focus in
        configuring the tools needed to work on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Express is also very <b>well-documented</b>. Whenever I encounter an
        issue, all it takes to solve it is a simple Google search. This taught
        me the value of using well-established technologies with a large user
        base to make debugging and seeking help much easier. This really made me
        appreciate the essence of teamwork and collaboration in software
        development, because coding is not always a thing that you do all by
        yourself. Everything that I use, from the programming languages and
        software to the frameworks and tools, are created and maintained by
        other people. Therefore, I should always try to participate in the
        community of these technologies, such as Express.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="subheading">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, Express has taught me more than just how to build a backend, it
        has shown me the importance of simplicity, well-documented code, and
        working with tools that align with my strengths. I’ve realized that
        choosing technologies with good documentation and a strong community
        isn’t just convenient, it shapes the way I approach problems, learn new
        concepts, and build maintainable systems. Looking back, Express didn’t
        just make development easier, it helped me grow as a backend developer,
        giving me the confidence to experiment, explore, and create without
        feeling overwhelmed. For anyone interested in starting their journey
        into this kind of development, I believe Express offers not just a
        framework, but a way to understand the bigger picture of how web
        applications truly work.
